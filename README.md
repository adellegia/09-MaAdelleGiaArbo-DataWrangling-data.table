# Data wrangling at scale using data.table


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [Data wrangling at scale using data.table](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop/09-MaAdelleGiaArbo-DataWrangling-data.table) run by Adelle and Viraaj.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the modern data wrangling workflow with data.table. Data wrangling is one of the core steps in the data science workflow, specifically when cleaning raw dets sets into a format that is readily analyzable. dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges, including the manipulation of datasets and variables. 

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the data.table package and data wrangling workflow, (2) demonstrate the ease of using data.table through highlighting the most common data wrangling functions, and (3) provide you with a practice exercise and further resources.
